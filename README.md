HubTaxi: ClientSide
===

The clientside have 3 part:
- Manager: To manage all driver and user.
- Driver: For drivers used.
- Client: Hybrid app for users.

We used bower to manager all dependencies. You must run: `bower install` to install all dependencies for this app.
To run app, locate each part to server static (such as apache, nginx root directory) and see it on localhost.

In addition, I provide a apk file named HubTaxi.apk to install android machine. I also provide an application for OSX. You can search keywork "HubTaxi" on apple store, instal and feel. :-)
